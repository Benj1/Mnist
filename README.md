# Mnist
A 93% accurate MNIST predictor.

My attempt at solving the MNIST classification problem using Python and a simple neural net implemented in Pytorch. The model achieves accuracy of approximately 93% on the test data.

I used the training and test data from https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv
